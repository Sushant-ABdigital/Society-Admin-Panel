# Society-Admin-Panel
This was the project left by the client after starting it.

It showcases my CSS skill to create the admin panel for one the society in India.
You can see the the current version [here](https://admin-panel-test.netlify.com/)

## Features
- Responsive
- Used google chart librry for charts on this panel.
- Customized legends in google library  - I found it was one of the difficult task!

Thanks.
